        <p>My dearest Celestial Queen,</p>

        <p>Under this canopy of stars — each one softly glowing like a whisper from my soul — I write these words for you.</p>

        <p>Each heart-shaped light above mirrors the way your love has lit the vast constellations of my existence.</p>

        <p>You are the moon to my tides, the fate in my signs, the gentle pull of destiny when all else feels adrift.</p>

        <p>This letter is not just a note — it is a constellation of thoughts, strung together in the shape of you.</p>

        <p>Even the stars blink slower when I think of your smile. Time pauses — not out of fear, but reverence.</p>

        <p>You are my mystery and my map, my storm and my sanctuary. A celestial force I orbit around, willingly lost and joyously found.</p>

        <p>Every heartbeat, a star. Every breath, a galaxy. And every moment I get to love you — an entire universe reborn.</p>

        <p>And if someday we forget all else, let this page remain — a frozen moment in eternity, where I said what I feel most clearly.</p>

        <p>That I love you — not just as a man loves a woman, but as the cosmos loves the void. Without condition. Without end.</p>
         <p>That I love you — not just as a man loves a woman, but as the cosmos loves the void. Without condition. Without end.</p>
